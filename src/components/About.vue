        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a passionate student, living in Germany. I'm currently studying at Werner Heisenberg Gymnasium in
            Garching and am a pre-college student at the Technical University of Munich, and have a strong interest in
            computer science and mathematics. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and solve challenging problems.
            My main interests in computer science are theory of computation, functional programming, and computer
            architecture. From University, I know Java, Python, and OCaml very well, but I am also familiar with
            JavaScript and Rust. At my school, I am part of the "TUMKolleg", a program with STEM subjects as its main
            focus.
